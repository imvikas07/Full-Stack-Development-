## Content Overview

### HTML Basics

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used for creating web pages and web applications. It consists of tags that define elements within the document, attributes that provide additional information about elements, and elements themselves which are the building blocks of HTML documents.

### JavaScript and jQuery

JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

### React JS

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

### Java Web Development

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

### Databases and Deployment

Relational databases are used to store and manage data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with a database. Agile development is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams.
